CycleGAN-Image-Transformation is a cutting-edge implementation that leverages the power of CycleGANs for unsupervised image-to-image translations using Keras. It enables users to transform images from one domain to another without paired training examples.

## Mathematical Overview

CycleGANs operate on the principle of learning mapping functions between two image domains, say \(X\) and \(Y\), without paired examples. The model comprises two generator functions \(G: X → Y\) and \(F: Y → X\), and two discriminator functions \(D_X\) and \(D_Y\).

The objective is to train the model so that:
1. \(G\) translates \(X\) to produce images that look similar to \(Y\), fooling \(D_Y\).
2. \(F\) translates \(Y\) to produce images that look similar to \(X\), fooling \(D_X\).

To ensure that the translated images are coherent with the source images, a cycle consistency loss is introduced:
\[ \mathcal{L}_{cyc}(G, F) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}(x)}[||F(G(x)) - x||_1] + \mathbb{E}_{y \sim p_{data}(y)}[||G(F(y)) - y||_1] \]

Where:
- \( \mathbb{E} \) denotes the expected value.
- \( ||.||_1 \) represents the L1 norm.

The total loss is a combination of the adversarial loss and the cycle consistency loss. The model aims to minimize this combined loss for better performance.
